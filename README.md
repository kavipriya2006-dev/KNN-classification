## Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies data points based on the majority class of their closest neighbors.

## Process

### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset

### 2. Data Preprocessing

### 3. Choose the Optimal `k` Value

### 4. Train the KNN Model

### 5. Evaluate Model Performance

### 6. Optimize the Model
